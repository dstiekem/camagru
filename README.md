# camagru
please switch to `massive` until I've fixed my merge conflicts

## words
a platform similar to a skeleton of instagram with photo editing, posting and reacting capabilities.

After cloning to the htdocs directory inside MAMP, launch bitnami's mamp and start the apache and mysql servers to test this application. In the browser open `http://localhost::8080/camagru/setup.php` this will build the database. if successful you should have a nice purple webpage telling you so. 

A user can make an account or view the content without logging in. only a logged in user can create, post and comment on content though. When creating an account be sure to check the spam folder as google doesnt like the jankness of a home mailserver.
when you can log in, navigate around the site. It's fun, and slow.
